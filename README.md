# Horiseon-module1-challenge

## Description

My motivation for refactoring this webpage was to make the page more accessible for both users and Horiseon. For the user, it improves their experience while navigating the webpage. For Horiseon, it improves their SEO and therefore increases reach, also it ensures legal compliance.

I learned that styling a website can be easily overcomplicated when classes are misused. When designing/styling a website, you should carefully consider how to minimize the amount of styling/code needed to achieve the desired effect.
